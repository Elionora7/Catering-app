## Business Logic

### Pricing Calculations

#### Simplified Pricing Model
```
Subtotal = Sum of (meal price × quantity) for all selected meals
Delivery Fee = Based on delivery zone:
  - Zone 1 (0-10km): $15
  - Zone 2 (10-20km): $30
  - Pickup: $0
Total = Subtotal + Delivery Fee
```

**No subscription discounts or weekly calculations** - Simple, transparent pricing.

### Order Type Rules

#### Standard Catering Orders
- **Minimum Order**: $90
- **Maximum Order**: $399 (orders ≥ $400 must be Event type)
- **Notice Required**: 2-4 days
- **Validation**: 
  - Server-side enforcement of minimum/maximum
  - Date validation (2-4 days from today)
  - Auto-suggests Event type if subtotal ≥ $400

#### Event Catering Orders
- **Minimum Order**: $400
- **Notice Required**: 7+ days
- **Validation**:
  - Server-side enforcement of minimum
  - Date validation (7+ days from today)
